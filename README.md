# Prework Study Guide

## Description

The aim of this webpage is to display and explain essential features and characteristics of four specific coding languages:HTML,CSS,Git and JavaScript. This webpage was created in order to provide an a glossary and information hub for students venturing into web development as beginners. Many students struggle with finding information or searching for a place to start when trying something new; thsi webpage not only aids them in doing so but is a something they can refer to throughout their entire web development journey. 

In producing this webpage, I have learnt the technicalities of each of these programing languages and developed computional thinking skills. Throughout this journey, my  hardest challenge was reading through my JavaScript code and attempting to debug. In the future, I intend to add more interactive features such as click event.
